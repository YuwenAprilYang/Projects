**Report:** [Telecom Churn Prediction Report](https://github.com/YuwenAprilYang/Projects/blob/451a81c4c3d01b720966a6be1705995074e2f5d5/Telecom%20Churn%20Prediction/Telecom%20Churn%20Report.pdf)  

**Tools:** Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib, SMOTE  

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using a real-world dataset. With customer retention being a major challenge, this study explores key factors influencing churn and builds predictive models to help telecom companies implement data-driven retention strategies.  

## üîç Key Highlights  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify churn patterns and feature correlations.  
- Addressed **class imbalance** using **SMOTE** and **class-weighting techniques**.  
- Built and compared **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost** models.  
- **XGBoost emerged as the best model**, achieving high **Recall (98.2%)** and **F1-score (98.0%)** under a class-weighted approach.  
- Used **SHAP values** to interpret feature importance‚Äî**Monthly Charges, International Plans, and Customer Service Calls** were the strongest predictors of churn.  
- Segmented customers into **low, medium, and high-risk categories** for targeted retention strategies.  

## üöÄ Future Enhancements  
- Implement **deep learning models** for further performance improvements.  
- Deploy a **real-time churn prediction system** for dynamic customer insights.  
- Incorporate **additional customer engagement metrics** to refine predictions.
